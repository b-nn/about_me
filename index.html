		<p>hello! I'm lannabann, although I go by many aliases (see <a href="about.html">about</a>)</p>
		<p><em>I'm 14</em> and also <em>trans</em>, I don't label my sexuality anymore, if you
			don't
			respect that then fuck off &lt;3 </p>
		<p>I've been using linux since the age of <em>12</em>(ish, can't remember exactly), and have
			been making
			random stuff
			since the age of <em>11</em> (9 if you count scratch)</p>
		<p>I'm currently using <em>rust</em> and have been trying on and off to get better at
			<em>drawing</em>, start learning <em>linear algebra</em>, and get into
			<em>graphics
				programming</em> (although have been having difficulties since it's generally (by
			generally,
			I mean I'm going off of <a href="https://youtu.be/O-2viBhLTqI?t=1316">one acerola video</a>)
			recommended you instead use an already existing engine, mostly unity, but unity has shitass
			support for
			any code editor/IDE other than vs code and visual studio, and if you don't wanna use an engine
			your only
			other option is a graphics API or library, and while rust is <em>capable</em> of graphics
			programming,
			pretty much all of your options are either just openGL wrappers (glium), or severely lack any
			sort of
			tutorials (miniquad), so far the only exception I've seen is wgpu, which takes inspiration from
			vulkan
			and isn't beginner friendly)
		</p>
		<p>((speaking of miniquad, I find it very funny that most responses on reddit are just people saying
			"just use
			macroquad instead"))</p>
		<p>this is <em>not</em> an exhaustive list of my interests, if you want to find more information
			about
			me, I recommend you go to the respective links below</p>
